###Goal
The purpose is to help Dana use JavaScript to populate an HTML table with UFO sighting data.

#Analysis 
Dana UFOs goal is to enhance the webpage with filters. We also have to make sure that we are precise in putting in our data. Java script has more case sensisitvity then other programs so we have to be careful with semicolons and expressions. Below is the webpage.

###Summary
We have a created a nice clean page for Dana allow filters and everything she wants.  The drawback for Dana is that we dont have enough data neccesarily to gain tractions for this. For Dana to improve on this website I recommend that she have more data to include how many people were at the site. We also dont have enough filters for Dana like more sittings and other string variables. Filerting it maybe better option because this then will allow us scrape live data better down the road.
